# Google_Calendar_Automation

Build a python script that calls the google api and gets my calendar events for this week and then categorises each event by the color and summarises the total time planned to be spent for each category.

To start use the script you first need to go to https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/python adn press the "ENABLE THE GOOGLE CALENDAR API" to activate it. 
Then you will get a popup with a file called credentials.json, that you will need to download.
After that just add that file to the project root folder and then in the console or terminal you can run it by typing in: python calendarauto.py
